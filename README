# Installing

If you have `go` installed for your local system, all you need do is:

``go get github.com/Princeton-CDH/fetch``

If your go binary path (`~/go/bin` by default) is on `PATH`, you can then just
run the program!

# Usage

```
fetch http://my.url
```
The program respects two flags `-max-depth` and `-max-routines` to limit the
depth of links to recurse and the number of goroutines to use, respectively.

The output will be CSV printed to stdout that you can pipe as you see fit.
